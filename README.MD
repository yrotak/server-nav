# Server navigation portal

This webpanel is used in my home server infrastructure, it holds behind a strong user authentification (username, password, TOTP, webauthn) all the passwords and TOTP codes for the others services (such as Proxmox, Uptime kuma, etc...). It also serves has a hub where you can navigate to other services without remembering the locals ips of each services.
